# Group Design Project: Hydrogen-Electric Regional Aircraft - Critical Design Review (CDR)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Critical Design Review (CDR) document for a Group Design Project undertaken as part of the BEng (Hons) Aerospace Engineering degree at the University of Hertfordshire. The project involved the conceptual and preliminary design of a novel 40-seat Hydrogen-Electric Regional Aircraft, aiming for technical viability, competitive performance, and consideration of environmental impact.

The project progressed through multiple phases, culminating in this CDR which details the finalised design aspects of the aircraft.

## My Individual Role & Contributions (Undercarriage, Weight & Balance, Certification Specialist - UW&C)
Within the Group 14 design team, I fulfilled the combined specialist role of Undercarriage Designer, Aircraft Weight Co-ordinator & Certification Specialist. My key responsibilities and contributions, detailed within the CDR, included:

*   **Undercarriage Design:**
    *   Defining the landing gear system configuration (retractable tricycle).
    *   Specifying components (oleo-pneumatic struts, wheels, tyres, carbon multi-disc brakes).
    *   Designing the retraction mechanism concept, including Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) integration.
    *   Calculating landing gear layout for stability and ground clearance.
    *   Assessing braking performance (RTO energy, landing distance considerations).
*   **Aircraft Weight & Balance Co-ordination:**
    *   Maintaining the detailed breakdown of component weights for the entire aircraft.
    *   Collecting component weight data from all specialist team members.
    *   Calculating key operational weights (MEW, OEW, MTOW 26,648 kg, MLW, MZFW).
    *   Determining the aircraft Centre of Gravity (C.O.G) position and operational envelope (25.8% - 33.1% MAC).
*   **Certification Specialist:**
    *   Identifying applicable airworthiness requirements (EASA CS-25).
    *   Anticipating Special Conditions for novel Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) fuel systems stored in the aft fuselage.
    *   Proposing means to address specific risks related to the hydrogen fuel system (crashworthiness, fire safety, leak detection).
    *   Outlining a proposed ground and flight test programme for type certification.

## Key Aircraft Features (Group Effort):
*   40-passenger capacity, ~500 nautical mile range.
*   Hydrogen-Electric fuelled propulsion system.
*   Aft LH2 tank storage.
*   Focus on compliance with EASA CS-25 standards.

## Skills & Technologies Demonstrated (My Contribution):
*   **Aircraft Systems Design:** Undercarriage systems, EHA concepts.
*   **Weight & Balance Engineering:** Detailed mass breakdown, CoG calculation, stability envelopes.
*   **Airworthiness & Certification:** Understanding of EASA CS-25, risk assessment for novel technologies.
*   **Technical Documentation & Reporting (CDR).**
*   **Multi-disciplinary Teamwork & Communication.**
*   **CAD (Conceptual for my sections):** SolidWorks (for visualising undercarriage concepts).
*   **Analytical Calculations:** For performance, W&B, landing loads.

This group project provided extensive experience in collaborative aircraft design, systems integration, and addressing the complex challenges of introducing novel propulsion technologies within a regulated aerospace environment. My specific sections within the CDR detail my contributions to the undercarriage, weight & balance, and certification aspects.
